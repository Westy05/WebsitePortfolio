                    <p class="fs-4">Since I was 5 years old, I was always fascinated by how much computers could achieve. From calculations for the Moon Landing to generative AI, computers have never ceased to impress me and continue to fuel my interest in technology, new and old. This strong interest grew into a blazing passion and curiosity that I follow day by day through robotics, internships, daily programming, and various projects.<br><br>From platforms such as Roblox all the way to Amazon Web Services, I have worked on several projects including an AI powered investment advisor, a roleplaying video game, and even a U.S. Navy project. Throughout these projects I have learned how to call APIs, utilize SQL, program in Java and C++, and much, much more. I even had the opportunity to see an old nuclear reactor from the 20th century and examine a classified rocket.<br><br>I am also no stranger to being part of a team as from my time being in the FIRST Robotics Team 5171 proves so. While on the team, I learned how to become both a leader and a mentor to others as well as a good teammate. As the programming sub-team leader, I handled a variety of duties including introducing new members to Java and the WPILib library, programming the autonomous system and drivetrain, and ensuring the robot was ready on a tight deadline. Thanks to mine and many other's efforts, our team became the very last finalists in the 2023 Silicon Valley Regional making it to the final match of the entire regional, something that had never happened before in our team's history.<br><br>As someone who has high functioning autism, I am truly proud of the challenging path I have taken to get to where I am today. It has not been easy to navigate this world for me but I have persevered through life's obstacles and continue to break through every problem thrown at me. Thanks to my never-ending perseverance and alternative way of thinking, I am now a diligent Computer Science undergraduate student at Santa Clara University. At SCU I have been constantly furthering my knowledge in computers, studying alongside wonderful people, and always seeking to do my best in every course as reflected in my GPA. Thank you for taking your time to read this and please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you are interested in hiring me.</p>
